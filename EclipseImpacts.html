    <h1> The Perspectives of Eclipses</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Using modern technology, scientists are looking at the impacts of eclipses from view points like the enviornment, wildlife, and the atmosphere.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align:left; color:gold;"> Life on Earth </h2>
    <p>Nasa has launched many projects that study how eclipses affect life on Earth, one being the Soundscapes project. It serves as a model for the use of a multi-sensory method to scientific observation and data collection. Using the help of the public, the Soundscapes projects wants to increase the number of people gathering data to advance the technology. It is a useful oppourtunity to study animal reactions towards drastic changes in natural stimuli. All the data collected is a free and open data source on SDAC. <a href="https://umbra.nascom.nasa.gov/newsite/data.html" style="color:cyan;">https://umbra.nascom.nasa.gov/newsite/data.html/</a> </p>
    <h2 style="text-align:left; color:gold;"> Earth's Upper Atmosphere </h2>
    <p>Solar eclipses have distinguishable impacts on the make-up of Earth's ionsphere, Earth's upper atmopshere, due to the sudden reduction of solar radiation during the eclipse. The altered ionsphere conditions can cause signal fading, absorption, and refraction, impacting shortwave and satellite systems. Solar eclipses give scientists to study this aspect and gather data about it. </p>
    <h2 style="text-align:left; color:gold;"> The Corona </h2>
    <p>The corona, the sun's outermost layer, is only visible during total solar eclipses. Studing it is key to solving questions heat and energy transfer questions about solar wind. Solar wind has the potential to affect technology so understanding it is crucial to being prepared. </p>
