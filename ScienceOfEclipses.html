    <h1> The Science Behind Eclipses</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2 style="text-align:left; color:gold;"> Syzygy </h2>
    <p>Since the Earth is always rotating and the Moon is constantly orbiting, the Moon's shadow will trace a path on the Earth's surface. During the rotation, the Earth, Moon and Sun will align on the same plane casuing an eclipse.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align:left; color:gold;"> Frequency </h2>
    <p>On average, there is one total and one solar eclipse every year, with visibility depending on location. The Moon's path usually falls over the ocean, so viewing one is rare</p>
    <h2 style="text-align:left; color:gold;"> Eclipse Prediction </h2>
    <p>Predicting eclipses takes a lot of precise math with consideration of other factors like gravitational fields. Scientists use the current position of the Earth and Moon in a complex eqution and then program a computer to execute it and forcast the relative positions.To do this data is collected from many NASA Mission like elevation data from SRTM , Lunar topography from LRO, planetary positions from JPL DE421 ephemeris, Earth imagery from NSASA's Blue Marble Next Generation to create a map that can show to the public the time machine going either past or future eclipse with exact date and time. This accuracy of prediction has enabled Scientist around the world to study eclipse impacts to earth and enviornment </p>
    <h2 style="text-align:left; color:gold;"> Eclipse Seasons </h2>
    <p>The moon orbits the Earth inclined at about 5 degrees. During the new moon, the Moon usually travels above or below the Sun, failing to cast its shadow on Earth. Eclipse seaons occur only two times a year when the new moon crosses the Earth and Sun's plane, giving a chance for an eclipse to happen. </p>
    <h2 style="text-align:left; color:gold;"> Why can only some people see them? </h2>
    <p>Solar eclipses are only visible to people who are in the shadow of the Moon. The Moon's shadow isn't very large so only a small portion of people on Earth will see it.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align:left; color:gold;"> Future Eclipses </h2>
    <p>Currently it is predicted that an annual solar eclipse will cross North, Central, and South America on October 14th, 2023 and a full solar eclipse will cover North America on April 8th, 2024. Don't miss these wondeful oppourtunities to witness these celestial events! Nasa provides a tool to calculate the exact location that will be hit with these eclipses. You can see the path of the 2023 and 2024 eclipses at  the Nasa website <a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5073" style="color:cyan;">https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5073</a>. This map is created with data from several nasa missions listed in Eclipse Predictions by visualizer Ernie Wright. Try your zipcode with the NASA tool to see the percentage visible of an eclipse at your location at <a href="https://eclipsesoundscapes.org/eclipse-lookup-tool/" style="color:cyan;">https://eclipsesoundscapes.org/eclipse-lookup-tool/</a>. This data is shared with the public and would benefit anyone trying to understand or witness this amazing phenomenon. </p>
